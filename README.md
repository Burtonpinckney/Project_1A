# Volunteer-Tracker

## Description

The Volunteer-Tracker program is designed to be used by charity, non-profits and similar organizations that benefit from volunteers who donate their time to their organization. Volunteer-tracker will track usable information concerning their volunteer's service so as to better utilize their volunteer workforce. This information can be used to make their volunteer staff more efficient, increase the amount of volunteers that donate their time and hopefully make their volunteer time more enjoyable while serving their community. Volunteer-Tracker will allow an organization to obtain a list of those who have volunteered, note the day and the city they volunteered in, track the amount of hours they have worked, the time that the submission was made and the start time of the project they volunteered for. It also will give the weather for that city the day of the event so organizations can see how that may have effected the volunteer turn out or the project itself.
